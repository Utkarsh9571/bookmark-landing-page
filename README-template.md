## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- javascript
- bootstrap

### What I learned

With this challgenge i got introduced to css frameworks, i watch course of bootstrap framework, its pretty nice, i tried to use it for some things and my plan was to use it for better screen responsiveness but that didn't work well, now i'll try it on next challenges, one thing i noticed in particularly css frmeworks, that like me if you're working on specific designs its not suitable on may things, but if you're working on you own project without any design specifications then its very helpful, hope js frameworks don't have that limitation.

### Continued development

For now i need to start with frontend but i'm going to continue backend devoloping and then if everything goes correctly then will countinue either in robotics coding and developement or in gaming industry.
